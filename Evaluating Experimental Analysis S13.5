The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective. Darth Vader develops an alternative slogan, "Together We Can Rule the Galaxy." They compare the slogans on two groups of 50 captured droids each. In one group, Emperor Palpatine delivers the "Anger" slogan. In the other, Darth Vader presents the "Together" slogan. 20 droids convert to the Dark Side after hearing Palpatine's slogan, while only 5 droids convert after hearing Vader's. The Sith's data scientist concludes that "Anger" is a more effective slogan and should continue to be used.

Flaw: Here, sample is divided into 2 groups. But they did not divide it considering any factors related to demographic or pshycographic profiles of the droids.
Correction: Before dividing the sample into groups, droid's demographic and psychographic factors are to be considered to make sure there is no "Assignment to Condition" bias.
