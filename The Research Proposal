Problem Statement: How to improve the conversion rate of the droids? The Sith Lords are concerned that their recruiting slogan, "Give In to Your Anger," isn't very effective.

Solution: Propose a new slogan.

Initial design: A/B testing

Analysis plan: Divide the droids into 2 groups. Make sure the groups are of equal size, without any bias. There should not be any bias in terms of demographic
or psychographic factors. Test 'Anger' slogan on group 'A' and 'Together' slogan on group 'B'. The variable of interest is 'Droid conversion' in both groups.
Find the number of doids converted from each group. If the difference b/w the conversion rate from each group varies by 50% then declare the slogan with the highest conversion rate.
